# 3D-localisation-from-multi-view-projections

Our project involves leveraging data acquired from multiple projections (different viewpoints' angles) of a scene, to localise 3D indications on X-Ray images. Using image processing techniques and deep learning models, the goal is to optimize the localization of 3D indications within the studied object. Challenges include effectively using multi-view information, exploiting the acquisition geometry and combining image processing with deep learning for better accuracy.
